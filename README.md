This isn't a program you just run, just some parts you can put together however you like. It's Apache-licensed so you can just grab what you want.

The most interesting part is that I hadn't seen any examples of a GRU/LSTM that did what I wanted, so I designed my own genetic algorithm to figure out the parameters (that's the variable, "p" for parameters) and it's stored as numbers so they can all be manipulated the same way.
